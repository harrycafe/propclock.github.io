            <h3 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 2px grey;">The Personal History of David Copperfield</h3>
            <p style="padding: 10px; background-color:#f5f5f7;">The Personal History of David Copperfield is a film I did not expect to be incredibly amazing. So, I was shcoked at the gripping storyline, amazing acting and the small comedic elements. The film is based on the book David Copperfield by Charles Dickens, which, I must admit I havn't read. While I imagine the book is better than the film, the film does a good job at telling the story and staying entertaining while also including detailed settings and characters.</p>
            <p style="padding: 10px; background-color:#f5f5f7;">The cast includes Dev Patel as David Copperfield as well as Peter Capaldi and Ben Whishaw. I really enjoyed the film and would recomend. 7/10</p>

            <h3 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 2px grey;">Cats</h3>
            <p style="padding: 10px; background-color:#f5f5f7;">Okay, so my problem with cats isn't the special effects, but instead the story. Old Possum's Book Of Practical Cats, written by T. S. Elliot was a book of poems that inspired Andrew Lloyd Webber to compose a set of songs based on the poems, which was then turned into a musical. The original poems where loosely connected and thus the songs and musical has a very thin narrative plot. This style is similar to a concept musical where a story is centered around a theme that connects the story rather than having a propper plot. Many concept musicals have been succsessful, however it's hard to please a general audience with one.</p>
            <p style="padding: 10px; background-color:#f5f5f7;">Cats is arguably a concept muscical but, at the same time, it tries to have features of a plot. The result is a weak storyline consisting of a boring villian and hero. Mcavity's motive is weak and there is no character development present.</p>
            <p style="padding: 10px; background-color:#f5f5f7;">Overall, my opininon is that Cats is better suited to the stage, where people care more about amotsphere, performance and, the songs than the story and plot. I have to say that Cats was doomed from the start as a film because people watching a movie want to see a story with a strong plot rather than a collection of songs tied together with a thin narrative. I give Cats as a film 2/10.</p>

            <h3 style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 2px grey;">James Bond: Casino Royal</h3>
            <p>My favourite of the Daniel Craig saga so far, Casino Royal packs an action-packed plotline with a parkour opening that's sure to get your blood pumping. But, a bond movie is only as good as its villian and Le Chiffre might have evil intentions at heart but he can come across as not very hateable. That aside, with lots of twists, and a compelling storyline and subplot, Casino Royal is, in my opinion, the best start to a great James Bond Saga. 7.5/10</p>
